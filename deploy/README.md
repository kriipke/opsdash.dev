## CRD: `CIPipeline`
- **Source Repository:**  
  Defines where the source code is located (repository URL and branch) and how to authenticate to it (using inline Vault credentials via the **externalSecret** field or by referencing an existing Kubernetes secret via the **existingSecret** field).

- **CI System:**  
  Specifies which CI system will be used (e.g. Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Azure Pipelines).

- **Triggers:**  
  Defines which events (like a push or pull request) and branch filters will trigger the pipeline.

- **Pre-Build Steps:**  
  These are steps that validate and prepare the source code prior to building the container image. They include:
  - **Linters:** For static code analysis.
  - **Code Reviews:** Which may be performed by a human or an LLM tool.
  - **Custom Steps:** For arbitrary shell command execution.
  - **Secret Scans:** For detecting secrets embedded in the code.

- **OCI Build:**  
  Contains the configuration for building the container image. It includes:
  - The Dockerfile path,
  - The build context,
  - A tagging strategy (e.g. using the Git commit, semantic versioning, or a custom tag).  
  If a custom tag is required (i.e. if the tagging strategy is set to `"custom"`), a validating webhook is expected to enforce that the **customTag** field is provided.

- **OCI Registry:**  
  Contains the configuration for pushing the built image to a container registry. Credentials for registry access are defined similarly to the repository credentials.

- **Notifications:**  
  Contains configuration for notifying users (via a webhook URL or email) when pipeline events occur.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Top-Level CRD Fields:**
   - **apiVersion, kind, metadata:**  
     Standard Kubernetes fields. The metadata section includes an option to preserve unknown fields (such as user-defined labels and annotations).
     
   - **spec.group, spec.scope, spec.names:**  
     Define the group (`opsdash.dev`), namespace scope, and naming conventions (plural, singular, kind, short names) for CIPipeline objects.

2. **Components/Schemas Section:**
   - **SecretSource:**  
     This schema provides the configuration for sourcing credentials from HashiCorp Vault. It supports two methods:
     - **Inline Credentials (authCredentials):** Credentials are provided directly within the resource.
     - **Existing Secret (existingSecret):** A reference to a Kubernetes Secret that holds the credentials.
     
   - **CodeReview:**  
     Defines the parameters for a code review step. It allows the specification of a reviewer type (human or LLM) and a reviewer identifier (e.g. an email or tool name).
     
   - **Linter:**  
     Specifies a linting step. It includes the linter tool name, configuration file path, and file patterns to scan.
     
   - **SecretScan:**  
     Configures a tool to scan the source code for embedded secrets. It includes the tool name, configuration file, and file patterns.
     
   - **CustomStep:**  
     Defines a custom execution step, allowing for arbitrary commands to be run in a container environment. It requires both a command and a container image. It can also specify success criteria (expected exit status and output matching a regular expression).
     
   - **Repository:**  
     Describes how to access the source repository. This includes the repository URL, branch, and the method for providing credentials (either inline via externalSecret or by referencing an existing secret).
     
   - **CIPipeline (spec):**  
     The main specification for a CI pipeline. It is composed of:
     - **srcRepository:** Repository configuration.
     - **ciSystem:** Specifies which CI system to use (with allowed values such as jenkins, github, gitlab, azure).
     - **triggers:** Configuration for event-based triggers (event type and branch filter).
     - **Pre-Build Steps:**  
       Arrays of steps (linters, codeReviews, customSteps, secretScans) to be executed before building the container image.
     - **ociBuild:**  
       Configuration for building the container image. It specifies the Dockerfile path, build context, and tagging strategy (with an optional custom tag when needed).
     - **ociRegistry:**  
       Contains details for pushing the built image to a registry. Credentials are provided similarly to the repository configuration.
     - **notifications:**  
       Contains configuration for sending notifications (via webhook and email) on pipeline events.

3. **Validation & Enforcement:**
   - Many fields include detailed descriptions and constraints (such as enum values) to guide users.
   - Conditional requirements (e.g. providing customTag if taggingStrategy is "custom") are documented; actual enforcement is expected to be performed via a validating admission webhook.

This fully documented CIPipeline CRD should serve as a comprehensive specification for managing CI pipelines in your environment. Feel free to adjust the comments or descriptions as needed for your operational and documentation requirements. Happy deploying!

Below is a sample section you can include in your README that explains the general operation of both the mutating and validating admission webhooks used with the CIPipeline CRD. This section describes the responsibilities of each webhook, the types of transformations and validations they perform, and how they help ensure that only correctly configured pipeline objects are stored in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Webhook Operation Overview

This project leverages two complementary admission webhooks to ensure the integrity and correctness of CIPipeline custom resources before they are persisted in the cluster:

### 1. Mutating Admission Webhook

The **mutating webhook** is responsible for transforming incoming CIPipeline objects to a normalized format. Its primary functions include:

- **Unified Pre-Build Steps Transformation:**  
  Users provide pre-build tasks in a single, unified array named `preBuildSteps`. The mutating webhook processes this array by:
  - **Sorting and Segregating Tasks:**  
    It identifies each taskâ€™s type (e.g., Linter, CodeReview, CustomStep, SecretScan) and moves them into dedicated arrays (`linters`, `codeReviews`, `customSteps`, and `secretScans`) within the CIPipeline object.
  - **Job Number Assignment:**  
    Each task is assigned a `jobNumber` corresponding to its original order. This ordering is essential for downstream systems to execute the tasks in the intended sequence.
  
- **Data Normalization:**  
  In addition to reordering tasks, the webhook may perform additional normalization on the input data (e.g., trimming whitespace, converting strings to lowercase where appropriate) to ensure consistency across pipeline configurations.

*By centralizing these transformations, the mutating webhook allows users to supply a simple list of pre-build steps while ensuring that the stored CIPipeline object is structured and ordered correctly for later processing.*

### 2. Validating Admission Webhook

The **validating webhook** is responsible for enforcing business rules and configuration constraints on incoming CIPipeline objects. Key validations include:

- **OCI Build Validation:**  
  If the `ociBuild.taggingStrategy` is set to `"custom"`, the webhook checks that the `ociBuild.customTag` field is provided. If this field is missing, the webhook rejects the admission request with a clear error message.
  
- **Credential Validation:**  
  In both the `srcRepository` and `ociRegistry` sections, the webhook validates that exactly one method of providing credentials is used. This means:
  - **Either** an inline secret configuration via the `externalSecret` field **or** a reference via the `existingSecret` field must be provided.
  - If both or neither are provided, the webhook returns an error, preventing misconfiguration.
  
- **Additional Custom Validations:**  
  The webhook can also be extended to perform other checks as needed, ensuring that all required fields are correctly set and that the object conforms to organizational standards.

*The validating webhook ensures that only well-formed and fully compliant CIPipeline objects are accepted into the cluster, reducing the risk of runtime errors or misconfigurations in your CI/CD processes.*

### Summary

Together, these webhooks help maintain a high level of consistency and reliability in your CI/CD operations:

- **The Mutating Webhook** simplifies user input by accepting a single list of pre-build steps and transforming it into a structured, ordered format.
- **The Validating Webhook** enforces critical business rules and configuration constraints (such as credential exclusivity and mandatory custom tags), preventing misconfigured pipelines from being deployed.

These automated processes ensure that every CIPipeline object entering the system is both syntactically correct and semantically valid, enabling downstream controllers and build processes to operate smoothly.
