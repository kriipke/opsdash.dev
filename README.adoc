== `CIPipeline` Usage

=== Example 1: Minimal Pipeline Using Existing Secrets

==== CIPipeline Manifest

In this simple example, both the source repository and the container registry credentials are provided via existing Kubernetes secrets. No pre‑build steps or triggers are defined.

```yaml
apiVersion: opsdash.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CIPipeline
metadata:
  name: minimal-pipeline
spec:
  srcRepository:
    url: "https://github.com/example/minimal-repo.git"
    branch: "main"
    # Use an existing Kubernetes secret for repository credentials.
    existingSecret: "minimal-repo-credentials"
  ciSystem: "github"
  ociBuild:
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
    context: "."
    taggingStrategy: "git-commit"
  ociRegistry:
    url: "registry.example.com"
    repository: "minimal/repo"
    # Use an existing Kubernetes secret for registry credentials.
    existingSecret: "minimal-registry-credentials"
```

==== Rendered Output (Simulated)

For a minimal pipeline where both repository and registry credentials come from existing Kubernetes secrets, the application might output a GitHub Actions workflow like this:

```yaml
name: Minimal Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          # The repository URL/branch is taken from the CIPipeline spec.
          repository: example/minimal-repo
          ref: main

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: |
          echo "Building Docker image using Dockerfile"
          docker build -f Dockerfile -t registry.example.com/minimal/repo:latest .

      - name: Push Docker Image
        run: |
          echo "Pushing Docker image to registry"
          docker push registry.example.com/minimal/repo:latest
```

In this pipeline, the checkout step uses the repository URL and branch from the CIPipeline manifest, and the Docker build/push steps operate on the provided Dockerfile and registry information.


---

=== Example 2: Complex Pipeline Using Inline ExternalSecrets with Hardcoded Vault Credentials

This example illustrates a more advanced pipeline with triggers, pre‑build steps (organized into separate arrays), and notifications. Both the repository and registry credentials are provided via inline externalSecret definitions that include Vault connection details and hardcoded tokens.

```yaml
apiVersion: opsdash.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CIPipeline
metadata:
  name: complex-pipeline-inline-secrets
spec:
  srcRepository:
    url: "https://github.com/example/complex-repo.git"
    branch: "develop"
    # Inline externalSecret with hardcoded Vault credentials for the repository.
    externalSecret:
      vaultAddress: "https://vault.example.com"
      secretPath: "secret/data/complex-repo-creds"
      authMethod: "token"
      authCredentials:
        token: "s.INLINE_REPO_TOKEN"
  ciSystem: "jenkins"
  triggers:
    event: "push"
    branch: "develop"
  preBuildSteps:
    - type: Linter
      name: "eslint"
      configPath: ".eslintrc.json"
      globPatterns:
        - "src/**/*.js"
    - type: CodeReview
      codeReviewerType: "human"
      codeReviewer: "reviewer@example.com"
    - type: CustomStep
      command: "npm run audit"
      shell: "bash"
      containerImage: "node:14"
      successCriteria:
        statusCode: 0
        outputRegex: "Build succeeded"
    - type: SecretScan
      toolName: "trufflehog"
      globPatterns:
        - "**/*.js"
      configPath: "trufflehog-config.yml"
  ociBuild:
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile.complex"
    context: "app/"
    taggingStrategy: "semver"
  ociRegistry:
    url: "registry.example.com"
    repository: "complex/repo"
    # Inline externalSecret with hardcoded Vault credentials for the registry.
    externalSecret:
      vaultAddress: "https://vault.example.com"
      secretPath: "secret/data/complex-registry-creds"
      authMethod: "token"
      authCredentials:
        token: "s.INLINE_REGISTRY_TOKEN"
  notifications:
    webhook: "https://hooks.example.com/notify"
    email: "ops@example.com"
```

==== Rendered Output (Simulated)


For a more complex pipeline (with linting, code review, a custom build step, secret scanning, and notifications) targeting Jenkins, the application might render a Declarative Pipeline (Jenkinsfile) as follows:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    // Trigger configuration: here we simulate a push trigger on branch 'develop'
    triggers {
        pollSCM('H/5 * * * *')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Repository') {
            steps {
                // Checkout from the repository using the provided URL and branch.
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                          branches: [[name: 'develop']],
                          userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/example/complex-repo.git']]
                ])
            }
        }

        stage('Pre-Build Steps') {
            parallel {
                stage('Linter (Job #1)') {
                    steps {
                        // Job #1: Linter step from the transformed "linters" array.
                        echo "Running ESLint as Job #1"
                        // Execute ESLint with the provided configuration and glob patterns.
                        sh 'eslint -c .eslintrc.json "src/**/*.js"'
                    }
                }
                stage('Code Review (Job #2)') {
                    steps {
                        // Job #2: Code review step from the transformed "codeReviews" array.
                        echo "Notifying reviewer@example.com for code review (Job #2)"
                        // In a real pipeline, this might send a notification or require manual intervention.
                    }
                }
                stage('Custom Build Step (Job #3)') {
                    steps {
                        // Job #3: Custom build step from the transformed "customSteps" array.
                        echo "Executing custom build step: npm run build (Job #3)"
                        // Running the build step inside a Node.js container.
                        script {
                            docker.image('node:14').inside {
                                sh 'npm run build'
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                stage('Secret Scan (Job #4)') {
                    steps {
                        // Job #4: Secret scanning step from the transformed "secretScans" array.
                        echo "Performing secret scan using trufflehog (Job #4)"
                        sh 'trufflehog --config trufflehog-config.yml .'
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('OCI Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building Docker image using Dockerfile.complex in the 'app/' directory"
                // Change directory to 'app' and build the Docker image.
                dir('app') {
                    sh 'docker build -f Dockerfile.complex -t complex-repo:latest .'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('OCI Registry Push') {
            steps {
                echo "Tagging and pushing Docker image to registry"
                // Tag the image and push it to the registry.
                sh 'docker tag complex-repo:latest registry.example.com/complex/repo:latest'
                sh 'docker push registry.example.com/complex/repo:latest'
            }
        }

        stage('Notification') {
            steps {
                echo "Sending build notification"
                // Send a notification (for example, via a webhook).
                sh 'curl -X POST -d "Build succeeded" https://hooks.example.com/notify'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        failure {
            // In case of failure, send an email notification.
            mail to: 'ops@example.com',
                 subject: "Jenkins Build Failed: ${env.JOB_NAME}",
                 body: "Please check the Jenkins build logs for details."
        }
    }
}
```

===== Explanation
Checkout Stage:
The repository is checked out using the URL and branch specified in the CIPipeline manifest.

Pre-Build Steps:
A parallel block runs the pre-build steps. In this design, the webhook has already sorted the unified preBuildSteps into four distinct arrays. For simplicity, we illustrate them sequentially here (in parallel, you might run them concurrently if appropriate). Each step echoes its job number (as assigned by the webhook) and executes its respective command:

Linter (Job #1): Runs ESLint.
Code Review (Job #2): Simulates a code review (for instance, by sending a notification).
Custom Build (Job #3): Executes a custom build command inside a Node.js container.
Secret Scan (Job #4): Runs a secret scanning tool.
OCI Build & Push:
The image is built using a custom Dockerfile (located in the app/ directory) and then tagged and pushed to the specified container registry.

Notification Stage:
A final notification step sends a webhook call to indicate build success.

Post Actions:
If the build fails, an email notification is sent to the operations team.

This Jenkinsfile provides an end-to-end example of how your transformed CIPipeline manifest might be rendered into a functional Jenkins pipeline. Adjust the commands and stages as needed to match your actual CI/CD environment and tooling conventions.

Happy deploying!

=== Example 3: Mixed Credential Approaches

==== CIPipeline Manifest

In this example, the repository credentials are provided via an existing secret while the registry credentials use an inline externalSecret that itself references an existing Kubernetes secret (via its `existingSecret` field). This mixed approach allows you to mix and match your credential sourcing methods.

```yaml
apiVersion: opsdash.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CIPipeline
metadata:
  name: mixed-credentials-pipeline
spec:
  srcRepository:
    url: "https://github.com/example/mixed-repo.git"
    branch: "main"
    # Use an existing Kubernetes secret for repository credentials.
    existingSecret: "mixed-repo-credentials"
  ciSystem: "gitlab"
  preBuildSteps:
    - type: Linter
      name: "eslint"
      configPath: ".eslintrc.json"
      globPatterns:
        - "src/**/*.js"
  ociBuild:
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
    context: "."
    taggingStrategy: "custom"
    customTag: "v2.0.1"
  ociRegistry:
    url: "registry.example.com"
    repository: "mixed/repo"
    # Inline externalSecret that references an existing secret for registry credentials.
    externalSecret:
      vaultAddress: "https://vault.example.com"
      secretPath: "secret/data/mixed-registry-creds"
      authMethod: "appRole"
      existingSecret: "mixed-registry-vault-secret"
```

==== Rendered Output (Simulated)

When the repository credentials come from an existing secret and the registry credentials use an inline externalSecret (which itself references an existing secret), the application might render a GitLab CI pipeline (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) like this:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml for Mixed Credentials Pipeline

stages:
  - prebuild
  - build
  - deploy

# Pre-Build stage: after mutation, the single preBuildSteps item appears in the "linters" array.
prebuild:
  stage: prebuild
  script:
    - echo "Job #1 (Linter): Running ESLint on source files"
    - eslint -c .eslintrc.json "src/**/*.js"

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Cloning repository from https://github.com/example/mixed-repo.git (branch: main)"
    - git clone --branch main https://github.com/example/mixed-repo.git
    - echo "Building Docker image using Dockerfile"
    - docker build -f Dockerfile -t mixed-repo:latest .
    - docker tag mixed-repo:latest registry.example.com/mixed/repo:latest

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Pushing Docker image to registry"
    - docker push registry.example.com/mixed/repo:latest
```

=== Example 4: Advanced Pipeline with Multiple Pre‑Build Steps and Advanced Triggers

==== CIPipeline Manifest

This comprehensive example shows an advanced configuration that includes multiple pre‑build steps (two linters, one code review, one custom step, and one secret scan), detailed triggers (for pull requests on feature branches), and notifications. The repository credentials are specified via an inline externalSecret referencing an existing Kubernetes secret, while the registry credentials are provided by an existing secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: opsdash.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CIPipeline
metadata:
  name: advanced-pipeline
spec:
  srcRepository:
    url: "https://github.com/example/advanced-repo.git"
    branch: "feature/advanced"
    # Inline externalSecret referencing an existing secret for repository credentials.
    externalSecret:
      vaultAddress: "https://vault.example.com"
      secretPath: "secret/data/advanced-repo-creds"
      authMethod: "kubernetes"
      existingSecret: "advanced-repo-vault-secret"
  ciSystem: "azure"
  triggers:
    event: "pull_request"
    branch: "feature/*"
  preBuildSteps:
    - type: Linter
      name: "pylint"
      configPath: "pylintrc"
      globPatterns:
        - "src/**/*.py"
    - type: CodeReview
      codeReviewerType: "llm"
      codeReviewer: "openai-gpt"
    - type: CustomStep
      command: "pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q"
      shell: "bash"
      containerImage: "python:3.8"
      successCriteria:
        statusCode: 0
        outputRegex: "All tests passed"
    - type: SecretScan
      toolName: "detect-secrets"
      globPatterns:
        - "**/*.py"
      configPath: "detect-secrets-config.yml"
  ociBuild:
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile.advanced"
    context: "build/"
    taggingStrategy: "custom"
    customTag: "v3.5.2"
  ociRegistry:
    url: "registry.advanced.com"
    repository: "advanced/repo"
    # Use an existing Kubernetes secret for registry credentials.
    existingSecret: "advanced-registry-credentials"
  notifications:
    webhook: "https://hooks.advanced.com/notify"
    email: "advanced-ops@example.com"
```

==== Rendered Output (Simulated)

For an advanced configuration that includes multiple linting stages, code review via an LLM, custom testing, secret scanning, a custom OCI build with a custom tag, and notifications, targeting Azure Pipelines the rendered output might look like this:

```yaml
# azure-pipelines.yml for Advanced Pipeline

trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - 'feature/*'
pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - 'feature/*'

jobs:
- job: PreBuild
  displayName: 'Pre-Build Steps'
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - script: |
      echo "Job #1 (Linter): Running pylint on source files"
      pylint --rcfile=pylintrc src/**/*.py
    displayName: 'Linter (Job #1)'
  - script: |
      echo "Job #2 (Code Review): Notifying openai-gpt for review"
      # In a real pipeline, this step might trigger a notification or manual intervention.
    displayName: 'Code Review (Job #2)'
  - script: |
      echo "Job #3 (Custom Step): Running tests with pytest"
      pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
    displayName: 'Custom Step (Job #3)'
  - script: |
      echo "Job #4 (Secret Scan): Running detect-secrets scan"
      detect-secrets scan --config-file detect-secrets-config.yml
    displayName: 'Secret Scan (Job #4)'

- job: BuildAndDeploy
  displayName: 'OCI Build and Registry Push'
  dependsOn: PreBuild
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - checkout: self
  - script: |
      echo "Building Docker image using Dockerfile.advanced in the 'build/' directory"
      cd build
      docker build -f Dockerfile.advanced -t advanced-repo:$(Build.BuildId) .
    displayName: 'OCI Build'
  - script: |
      echo "Tagging and pushing Docker image"
      docker tag advanced-repo:$(Build.BuildId) registry.advanced.com/advanced/repo:$(Build.BuildId)
      docker push registry.advanced.com/advanced/repo:$(Build.BuildId)
    displayName: 'OCI Registry Push'
  - script: |
      echo "Sending notification"
      curl -X POST -d "Build completed" https://hooks.advanced.com/notify
    displayName: 'Notify'
```

This Azure Pipelines YAML file defines a job that:
- Triggers on pull requests and pushes to feature branches.
- Checks out the repository.
- Runs two linter steps (pylint and flake8) over Python source files.
- Executes a simulated code review step.
- Runs a custom test suite with pytest.
- Scans for secrets using detect-secrets.
- Builds a Docker image from a custom Dockerfile located in the `build/` directory (tagged with a custom tag, e.g., `v3.5.2`).
- Pushes the built image to the advanced registry.
- Finally, sends a notification via a webhook.
---

These examples demonstrate the flexibility of the latest CIPipeline CRD. They cover scenarios from a minimal pipeline using existing secrets to complex pipelines with multiple pre‑build steps, advanced triggers, and mixed approaches for credential sourcing. Adjust the values and configurations as needed to match your environment and operational requirements.
