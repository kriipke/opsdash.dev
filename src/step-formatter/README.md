Yes, that's definitely a feasible approach. In short, you can design your CRD to include a single, polymorphic array (with an explicit `"type"` field on each item) and then use a transforming (mutating) webhook to reformat that data into a structure that complies with your downstream processing expectations—and possibly even with stricter CRD structural schema rules.

Below are some details on how this could work:

---

### 1. **The Input Structure**

You’d define your CRD so that the `preBuildSteps` field is an array where each item must include a `"type"` field. For example:

```yaml
preBuildSteps:
  type: array
  items:
    type: object
    required:
      - type
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        enum: ["Linter", "CodeReview", "CustomStep", "SecretScan"]
      # Allow additional properties for each step.
```

A sample manifest might look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: opsdash.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CIPipeline
metadata:
  name: example-pipeline
spec:
  srcRepository:
    url: "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
    branch: "main"
    credentialsSource: "kubernetes-secret"
    credentialsRef:
      name: "repo-credentials"
      key: "token"
  ciSystem: "github"
  preBuildSteps:
    - type: Linter
      name: "mypy"
      configPath: "mypy.ini"
      globPatterns:
        - "src/**/*.py"
    - type: CodeReview
      codeReviewerType: "llm"
      codeReviewer: "openai-gpt"
  ociBuild:
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
    context: "."
    taggingStrategy: "git-commit"
  ociRegistry:
    url: "registry.example.com"
    repository: "example/repo"
    credentialsSource: "kubernetes-secret"
    credentialsRef:
      name: "registry-credentials"
      key: "password"
```

In this input, every step is self-identifying. The `"type"` field lets you quickly tell whether a given step is a linter, a code review, or another kind of pre-build step.

---

### 2. **The Transformation**

A mutating webhook (or a controller using a conversion webhook) can process this input and transform it into a different structure. For instance, you might want to split the steps into separate top-level arrays:

```yaml
linters:
  - name: "mypy"
    configPath: "mypy.ini"
    globPatterns:
      - "src/**/*.py"
    jobNumber: 1
codeReviews:
  - codeReviewerType: "llm"
    codeReviewer: "openai-gpt"
    jobNumber: 2
```

This transformation can be useful if your processing logic downstream expects a more segregated layout, or if you want to apply additional validation that’s easier to do on separate arrays.

---

### 3. **Advantages of This Approach**

- **Clarity and Flexibility:**  
  The explicit `"type"` field makes it obvious which schema variant each pre-build step adheres to. This clarity simplifies processing, both for controllers and for users writing the manifests.

- **Transformation Logic:**  
  The webhook can add additional metadata (like `jobNumber`), normalize values, or even merge common settings. The transformation layer decouples the user-friendly input from the strict requirements of your internal processing or the limitations of Kubernetes’ CRD validation.

- **Compliance with Structural Schema Requirements:**  
  Since Kubernetes CRDs require structural schemas (which limit constructs like `oneOf`), having a single field with a simple `"type"` discriminator can simplify your CRD definition. The detailed variant validation can then be handled by the webhook, keeping the CRD schema simpler and more compliant.

---

### 4. **Implementing the Transforming Webhook**

Your transforming webhook would:

1. **Intercept the Admission Request:**  
   Listen for create or update events on your `CIPipeline` resources.

2. **Inspect the `preBuildSteps` Array:**  
   Iterate over the array and, based on the `"type"` field, separate items into different arrays (like `linters`, `codeReviews`, etc.).

3. **Modify the Object:**  
   Update the object’s spec to include the new arrays while optionally removing the original `preBuildSteps` field.

4. **Return the Mutated Object:**  
   Send back the modified object so that it is stored in the cluster in the desired structure.

Here’s a pseudo-code snippet to illustrate:

```python
def mutate_cipipeline(resource):
    spec = resource.get("spec", {})
    pre_build = spec.pop("preBuildSteps", [])
    linters = []
    code_reviews = []
    job_counter = 1

    for step in pre_build:
        step["jobNumber"] = job_counter
        job_counter += 1
        if step.get("type") == "Linter":
            linters.append(step)
        elif step.get("type") == "CodeReview":
            code_reviews.append(step)
        # Handle other types similarly...

    # Add the segregated arrays back into the spec.
    if linters:
        spec["linters"] = linters
    if code_reviews:
        spec["codeReviews"] = code_reviews

    resource["spec"] = spec
    return resource
```

You’d implement this logic in your webhook server (e.g., using Python with Flask, Go, etc.) and register the webhook with Kubernetes.

### Final Thoughts

Using a single `"type"` field in your input manifest is a practical and clean approach. It makes the user's intent explicit while allowing you to transform the input into a structure that meets both your internal needs and the Kubernetes CRD constraints. This pattern—separating user-friendly API design from internal processing via a transforming webhook—is common in complex Kubernetes operators and custom controllers.

Happy coding and deploying!
